    "## Questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Are accidents more frequent during weekdays or weekends? Is there any difference between before COVID-19 and after?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the 2nd chart on the right (paired bar chart), we can use the mean lines to compare overall if accidents are more frequent in weekends or in weekdays. We can expect there to be the same amount of amount of days for each days of the week (give or take one), which is why we can use the total sum of collisions. Indeed, we can use the means of weekdays (before *yellow/orange* and after *green* Covid) and the means of weekends and it is clearly higher on weekdays. We see that after Covid the total collisions are more equally distributed among the days of the week. The weekdays average is still higher than on weekends but not as pronounced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this chart we can also see that Fridays are the days with the most collisions (likely everyone is rushing for the weekend or simply tired from the long week) on the other hand, Sundays are the days with the least collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Is there any type of vehicle more prone to participate in accidents?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is very tricky. We would need to know (per vehicle) the amount of kilometers driven for the dates we have used, to get a good representation of this question. This is because cars are for sure the vehicle with the most collisions, simply because they are driven the most km. We tried our best to find data, spent several hours in fact, but it was either incomplete or simply wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2nd chart on the left (Vehicle Danger) has Deaths per collision in the y-axis and Injuries per collision in the x-axis and total collisions for size. We can see that cars have a total of 95263 collisions (they are the largest circle), representing around 90% of the collisions. This however does not imply that cars are are 90% more prone!\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. At what time of the day are accidents more common?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the third chart on the right (stacked bar chart) we can see that we have the most accidents from 16 to 17. Again, since hours are equally distributed throughout the day, we can use the total amount to indicate when accidents are more common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting to see the second highest maximum from 9 to 10. This latter peak corresponds with the beggining of the day and the former (16-17) with the end (when people go back home). Most collisions are concentrated from 8 to 20 (these are all over the mean).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, from 0(12)-1 we have quite a large peak that does not seem to follow the trend. This is likely due to data missing the time variable and being set at 00:00. This is not an oversight by us as we checked, and the Time variable in the original dataset has 0 nulls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Are there any areas with a larger number of accidents?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the map on the top left (opacity represents collisions per $km^2$) we can see that the Midtown Manhattan area as well as Fordham (Bronx) are the places with most collisions per $km^2$. Labels are placed in the district with most collisions per $km^2$ and the fourth most (because of space).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the map we can also see that a Horse crashed in Manhattan as well as a Go Kart in the Bronx! They are the sole cases of their respective vehicle type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Is there a correlation between weather conditions and accidents?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the purple heatmap on the right, we can see that as Rain, Wind and Visibility conditons worsen, we find more collisions per hour. We see a trend with darker colors when conditions are not perfect. For Rain and Visibility, we see that for terrible conditions we have a lower collision rate, we can explain this by thinking about how a human works. With heavy heavy rain we will realise easier that we must drive safer, with a light rain we may not even care. Same goes for Visibility. Wind on the other hand is different, as once we get into the car, noticing it is harder so we don't change how we drive as much.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, there is a correlation, we find more accidents when conditions are not perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extra\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What vehicles are the most dangerous?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the 2nd chart on the left scatter plot, we can see that two-wheelers injure more people per collision than four-wheelers! These latter vehicles have a chasis that protect the people inside in a collision, however, two-wheelers do not. If we look a bit closer, we see that the faster a two-wheeler is, the higher death rate! With motorcycle being the vehicle with most deaths per collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What is the main cause of accidents?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the left heatmap in the blue-teal pair at the bottom, it becomes evident that the primary causes of accidents are driving infractions and driver inattention. However, delving deeper into the chart reveals additional valuable insights. Notably, in the case of bicycles and e-bikes, accidents caused by pedestrian errors are more likely compared to other vehicle types. This indicates a heightened risk of accidents involving pedestrians in interactions with bicycles and e-bikes. Additionally, an interesting observation arises concerning bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters. In these vehicle categories, there is a higher percentage of accidents attributed to driver inattention. Curiously, these do not require a license to drive (except some e-scooters)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the right heatmap in the blue-teal pair at the bottom, we can break down the driving infractions that lead to accidents. Here are some notable examples: Firstly, ambulances stand out with a higher percentage of collisions attributed to \"passing too close.\" Similarly, in the case of bicycles, there is a higher percentage of collisions associated with \"Failure to Yield Right of Way\". These are just some highlighted examples, and a more in-depth analysis would reveal additional insights into specific driving infractions contributing to accidents."
