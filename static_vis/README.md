[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://nyc-collisions.streamlit.app)

Goal is to answer the following questions with adequate visualisations:
* Are accidents more frequent during weekdays or weekends? Is there any difference between before COVID-19 and after?
* Is there any type of vehicle more prone to participate in accidents?
* At what time of the day are accidents more common?
* Are there any areas with a larger number of accidents?
* Is there a correlation between weather conditions and accidents?

## Data
* Jun-Sep 2018 & Jun-Sep 2020 rows from the [NYC collision dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95). Find the dataset in a _csv_ format already filtered by date [here](./original-data/collisions.csv).
