# NYC Collisions Visualization

Projects done for the GCED, UPC course [Information Visualization](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-data-science-and-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/VI-GCED). Objective for each project was to answer several questions using a single view, using the python library [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html). Here are the two projects:

* [Static visualisation](static_vis): answers questions regarding collisions before and after COVID-19 in NYC. View final visualization in Streamlit [here](https://nyc-collisions.streamlit.app).

* [Interactive visualisation](interactive_vis): answers questions regarding collisions during the 2018 summer. Only considering taxis, ambulances and firetrucks.

You can view the final result in each folder!
